# Project Vision: Parallel Assistant

**North Star**: An always-on, OS-integrated AI agent that shares your peripherals to perform tangible work alongside you.

## What It Is
Parallel Assistant is a desktop overlay that allows an AI to control your **real system cursor** and keyboard. It is not just a chat window; it is a collaborative partner that lives in the "glass" above your applications, perceiving your screen and taking physical actions to complete tasks.

## The Agent Loop
To be useful, the agent must close the loop:
1.  **Perceive**: See the screen (screenshots) and accessibility tree.
2.  **Decide**: Plan a sequence of actions (Move, Click, Type).
3.  **Act**: Physically control the OS input devices to execute the plan.
4.  **Verify**: Check if the action had the intended effect.
5.  **Recover**: Retry or ask for help if verification fails.

## Why Real Cursor Control?
-   **Tangibility**: You see exactly what the agent is doing. There is no "hidden magic" or background API calls that might fail silently.
-   **Compatibility**: If a human can do it with a mouse and keyboard, the agent can do it. It works with *any* application.
-   **Trust**: By sharing the same physical cursor, the user and agent have a clear hand-off. You can physically see when the agent is working and instinctively take over if needed.

## User Authority & Safety
The user is always in control.
-   **States**:
    -   **INACTIVE**: Asleep.
    -   **ACTIVE**: Working. The agent owns the mouse.
    -   **PAUSED**: The agent detected you moved the mouse or typed. It yields immediately.
-   **Emergency Stop**: `Control+Alt+Esc` is the hard kill switch.

## Near-Term MVP: The "Cursor Pilot"
Our current focus is perfecting the **Act** layer.
-   We have a robust Electron overlay that handles state and visualization.
-   We have a Python sidecar that drives the real mouse.
-   We have "Power Steering" (WASD control) and "Autopilot" (Demo Motion) to prove the capability.
-   Crucially, we have solved the **Arbitration Problem**: differentiating agent actions from user actions to allow seamless hand-offs.

## Long-Term Vision
-   **Complex Tasks**: "Book me a flight," "Organize these files," "Fill out this form."
-   **Safety Gating**: The agent asks for confirmation before "Committing" (e.g., clicking 'Buy').
-   **Verification**: The agent knows when it missed a button and corrects itself.

# Project Context: Parallel Assistant (Electron Overlay MVP)

## Overview
This project is an Electron-based desktop overlay application designed to be "Always On" and provide persistent assistance capabilities. It features a transparent, click-through overlay window that covers the entire main screen.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: MVP Development / Debugging
- **Core Features**:
  - Full-screen transparent overlay.
  - Floating Control Panel for interaction.
  - "Intelligent Click-Through": Interactive elements catch clicks, empty space passes clicks to desktop.
  - **Hotkey**: `Control+Alt+Space` toggles visibility.
  - **Emergency Hotkey**: `Control+Alt+Escape` force-hides the overlay.
  - **Default State**: Visible on launch for development.
- **Tech Stack**:
  - Electron (Main process)
  - React + TypeScript (Renderer)
  - Vite (Build tool)

## Key Components
- **Main Process (`main.ts`)**:
  - Manages `BrowserWindow` state (always on top, transparent, click-through logic).
  - Handles global shortcuts (`Control+Alt+Space`).
  - Bridge for IPC events (`set-click-through`, `hide-overlay`).
- **Renderer (`App.tsx` & Components)**:
  - `OverlayRoot`: Main container (transparent).
  - `FloatingPanel`: Draggable* (planned) control panel. Manage interaction state.
  - `AgentCursor`: Visual simulation of an AI cursor.
  - `HighlightBox`: Visual simulation of UI highlighting.

## Recent Changes
- Fixed `Control+Alt` crash by changing hotkey to `Control+Alt+Space`.
- Implemented "Intelligent Click-Through": The main window ignores mouse events by default (forwarding them). The Renderer detects mouse enter/leave on the `FloatingPanel` to toggle input capturing.
- Removed background dimming to ensure true transparency.
- prevented minimization and set window type to `toolbar`.
- Moved `index.html` to root for Vite compatibility.

## Known Issues / TODOs
- "Draggable" implementation for FloatingPanel is not yet fully linked to window movement (requires IPC).
- Verify multi-monitor support (currently target primary display).
